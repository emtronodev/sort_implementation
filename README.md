# sort_implementation
Implementation of a sorting algorithm for C++

Problem
A) Given a random number generator RandomNumber(int seed) that returns an integer per call in the range of [0, 100,000), write a program in C++ that (1) generates 10,000,000 values, (2) sorts them in the increasing order, and (3) outputs the result to a file. Keep in mind the runtime performance of the program when programming.

B) Rewrite the program in A) assuming RandomNumber(int seed) returns a floating point number in the range of [0.0, 1.0) instead. Please note, however, that the program requires the sorting accuracy of 5 significant digits only.

C) Extend the program in B) to ensure the complete sorting accuracy.
